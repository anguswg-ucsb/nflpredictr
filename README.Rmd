# The `nflpredictr` R package provides a lightweight R package that provides predictions for upcoming (and past) NFL games. 
# `nflpredictr` provides four main things:
# 
#   1. Retrieves new data to use an inputs into a [ML model trained to predict the outcomes of NFL games](https://anguswg-ucsb.github.io/nfl_wins/)
#   2. Generate predictions using the new data
#   3. Visualize results.
#   4. Retrieve Las Vegas Odds and lines to compare with the predictions generated from `nflpredictr`

<hr>

The **`nflpredictr`** R package provides a lightweight R client for retrieving predictions for upcoming (and past) NFL games via the [NFL Win Predictor API](http://68.183.25.9:8000/__docs__/). Details on the model used to make the predictions can be found [here](https://anguswg-ucsb.github.io/nfl_wins/)

**`nflpredictr`** provides four main functionalities:

  1. Retrieves new data to use as the inputs into a [ML model trained to predict the outcomes of NFL games](https://anguswg-ucsb.github.io/nfl_wins/)
  2. Provide the new data to the [API](http://68.183.25.9:8000/__docs__/) and return predictions
  3. Visualize results.
  4. Retrieve Las Vegas Odds and lines to compare with the predictions generated from **`nflpredictr`**

## Installation

You can install the development version of **`nflpredictr`** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("anguswg-ucsb/nflpredictr")
```

## Example

**`nflpredictr`** provides utility functions for accessing game predictions from a Logistic Regression ML model that was trained on ~20 years of historic NFL data and [correctly predicts the outcomes of games ~69% of the time](https://anguswg-ucsb.github.io/nfl_wins/#Model_Performance_on_Test_Data).
If no inputs are given to **`predict_games()`**, the default behavior is to make a prediction for week 2 of the 2021 NFL season.
```{r example}
# Load package
library(nflpredictr)

# Make an API request using predict_games(), default week is the upcoming week of the season
nflpredictr::predict_games(
  year = 2021,
  week = 2
)
```

<br>

## Make predictions on past games
Predictions can also be requested for weeks of past NFL seasons, going as far back as the 2016 season.
```{r past_predictions}
# Make an API request using predict_games() for a specific year and week
nflpredictr::predict_games(
  year = 2018,
  week = 8
  )
```

## Make a tile plot of win probabilities
`nflpredictr` contains a few functions for quick plotting the outputs from **`predict_games()`**. The **`plot_tile()`** function will plot each match up side by side on a tile plot and color code teams by their predicted win probability from the NFL Win Prediction API.
```{r plot_tile, eval=FALSE}
# Plot the outputs from predict_games()
tile_plot <- nflpredictr::plot_tile(
                  predictions = nflpredictr::predict_games(
                    year = 2021,
                    week = 5
                  )
              )
```

<br>

## Plot the teams favored to win that week
The `plot_favored()` function will plot the teams favored by the NFL Win Prediction API model in order of win probability.
```{r plot_fav, eval=FALSE}
# Plot the outputs from predict_games()
fav_plot <- nflpredictr::plot_favored(
                predictions = nflpredictr::predict_games(
                                  year = 2021,
                                  week = 5
                                ),
                prob_alpha  = FALSE
                )
```
